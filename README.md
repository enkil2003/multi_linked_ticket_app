Multi-Linked Ticket App
=======================

This is the [Multi-Linked Ticket App](https://github.com/matttylr/multi_linked_ticket_app) for Zendesk. It is a fork of the original Zendesk [Linked Ticket App](https://github.com/zendesk/linked_ticket_app). The app allows you to create multiple child tickets to a ticket.

You currently have to build and upload it to your Zendesk instance using =zat package=. Please submit bug reports to [me](https://github.com/matttylr/multi_linked_ticket_app/issues). Pull requests are welcome.
